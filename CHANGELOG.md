# CHANGELOG V1.2.2

## HOTFIX
  - Turns out the pack selection introduced in 1.2.0 just didn't work and I was completely unaware
  - Due to an incorrectly placed 'i++', packs were determined by the number of checked boxes which ones were checked
  - This has now been fixed

## Other Changes
  - The brainrot pack now has a 'subway surfers card', the background of which is a gif of subway surfers gameplay
  - 'Light' and 'dark' categories removed from theme dropdown, it was a little too ambiguous

## Other
  - Refactored pack button and admin button names
  - Added a cookie to store last selected theme

## Known Issues
  - Despite major bugfixes in the last two updates mostly resolving the problem, the server does still occasionally crash when the last player disconnects
  - Players joining after game starts are not properly dealt in and are stuck on waiting screen
  - Czar can be changed when new player joins

# Likely coming in next few update(s)
  - I will attempt to create a queue for players joining mid-game, storing on server and pushing info to clients only at the start of a round
    - Note for myself, make sure to check queue size when players leave so new turn starts instead of game restarting if there aren't enough players
  - Not likely soon but I might add a lobby system at some point
